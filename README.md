# Pulsars-and-Double-Pendulums

In this repository you will find a Python notebook with code used to classify pulsar stars, and simulate the motion of a double pendulum. The notebook includes markdown cells with explanations of each of the steps taken as well as helpful links.   In addition, there is a term paper which delves deeper into the physics and computing background necessary to complete this project. I would like to thank GitHub users like you for sharing your code to the world! Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the code or the paper.
